This tool is too small and lightwieght to warrant a configure tool 
so check the Makefile (both in this directory and 'src'), make sure 
it's to your liking, and

    $ make
    $ make install


To uninstall:

    $ make uninstall

The default installation prefix is /usr/local/ which means
the binary will try to be installed in /usr/local/bin and
the manual documentation will try to be installed in 
/usr/local/man
If you, dear installer, plan on keeping these installation
directories, make sure that both "/usr/local/bin" and 
"usr/local/man/man1" exists and that they are in your
$PATH and $MANPATH, respectively.

On OS X, *don't* mess with the MANPATH; the manpath is
built intelligently

On OS X, to force the system to add qstats to the
apropos and whatis registry, you have to force run
makewhatis (which, isn't on your path) on the directory
of the man page install. It will look something like this:

    $ sudo /usr/libexec/makewhatis /usr/local/man/
