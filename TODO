flesh out header files, try to move as much into
the header files as possible

Create more flags (like for stddev) and exclusionary logic

use math.h floating point capabilities

More robust to memory limitations: look into temporary storage files

Be more clear with parsing errors

Have -u mode for utility output

Consider using forks more multiprocessing
