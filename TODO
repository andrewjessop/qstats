Create more flags (like for stddev) and exclusionary logic

use math.h floating point capabilities

write configure script

add more stats

write man file

add author and license info the the source files

fix tab spacing (especially with the frequency output)

More robust to memory limitations: look into temporary storage files

Be more clear with parsing errors

Have -u mode for utility output

Allow it to also read from a text file if a file name is provided
*Maybe allow multiple file names and print all of the 
results out saying which file the results came from

Be robust with respect to data type limits

Consider using forks more multiprocessing

Try to make 100% ANSI compliant and no errors on "pedantic"
