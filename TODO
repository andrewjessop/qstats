flesh out header files, try to move as much into
the header files as possible

Create more flags (like for stddev) and exclusionary logic

use math.h floating point capabilities

write configure script

add more stats

write man file

More robust to memory limitations: look into temporary storage files

Be more clear with parsing errors

Have -u mode for utility output

Be robust with respect to data type limits

Consider using forks more multiprocessing
