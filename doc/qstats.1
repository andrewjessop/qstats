.TH QSTATS 1 "OCT 2013" 
.SH NAME
qstats \- a quick and dirty statistics tool for the Unix pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B foo [-smhl] [-f<breaks>] [-b<breaks>]
.I file
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qstats
This tool reads one column of numeric data from either a file 
(or multiple files) or from stdin, and computes various summary 
statistics on it. Although it can be used directly on file(s), 
this is meant to be used mostly as the final command on a shell
pipeline combining 
.BR cut (1),
.BR tail (1),
.BR awk (1),
etc. on a tabular data file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -m
computes the mean
.IP -s
computes various summary statistics including min, max, quartiles, mean,
median, range, standard deviation (population), and length. This is the
default behavior if no flags are used.
.IP -l
outputs the length (equivalent to wc -l)
.IP -h
prints the help and usage
.IP "-f<breaks>"
creates a frequncy tabulation of the data points contained in 'breaks' number
of equally spaced bins. If no number if provided, then Sturge's Rule is used
to estimate the appropriate number of bins.
.IP "-b<breaks>"
creates an ASCII-art histogram (horizontal bar chart) representation of the 
density of the data points contained in 'breaks' number of equally spaced 
bins. If no number if provided, then Sturge's Rule is used to estimate 
the appropriate number of bins.
.SH BUGS
 \- only takes in numerics that do not exceed 50 digits long
 \- only is able to import and compute statistics on data that
can fit within memory
